Tabs
 1) Program Flow
    In this tab we will be doing all of the processing for the csv's 
 2) Reading Flagged Sessions and Documents
    In this tab there will be a snapshot of the file explorer in the sessions folder
    This snapshot will have all of the flagged sessions, then clicking on a session will expand to show the names of the flagged files
    Also in this tab the user will be able to Pay/Unpay a Session, Flag/Unflag a Session, Flag/Unflag a document (this will involve changing the note for the flagee)
    In addition, allow the user to view the metadata and delete a session
 3) File viewing
    This will be similar to the second tab except the user will only be printing the files
 4) Other functions
    This will be expanded on but for now just CRUD the clubs
Screens
 1) Welcome screen
        In this screen the user will be able to do three things, select a folder, select some csvs, or go next, next button will always be there but let's gray it out until something has been selected
        As for error catching, we'll just keep the next button greyed and have a status label below the buttons
        When files are selected, print out their names, if a file is not a csv, highlight it in red
        Select Folder button
        Select csvs button
        Status line
        Next button
 2) Session Creation screen
        User will pick a date
        User will pick a club
        User will be able to add a new club
        After user has picked a date and a club, next button will be ungrayed
        Next button
        Back button
 3) Assign Status screen
        Have a default status assigned in the metadata or in the state somewhere
        If default statuses have not been assigned yet, assign them
        Instead of an error window that pops up when next is erroneously clicked, make a graphic that does the following
            If a file is good to go: put a checkmark next to it's names
            If a file is not good to go: put an X, highlight it, then show the names under it
        Once all Person's are good to go, ungray the next button
        Back button
        Have a dropdown that populates when a thing is selected
        Have the counts be on the right side
 4) Assign Fee Schedule Screen
        Each file will have a number input, must be a positive integer or create a red x next to the file name
        Make a three column table, file name, status, price
        Have an input and a button for an assign all scheme
        Next button
        Back button
 5) Payment summary screen
