*1) Change Zorano column in summary table to the club name for the session
*2) Unify refresh button    
*3) Implement unflagging (revisit this, it's broken)
       User edits the csv  
       Program updates the flag status after checking
       Create another status column
       Change flagging to be based on the current status
*4) Put the current_status in the files so when loading a session the choices get remembered
       update browse any session file refresh too
*5) Refunds are free, fix the logic for that
*6) Double check the manual logic
*7) In the welcome screen, make a load session graphic
       Click once on a folder it expands it to reveal the files inside
       Click twice on a folder, pop up a confirmation to load the session
8*) Move the reset session button to its own tab?
       Mimic file edit design in the topleft, try to include current session name as a text label within the row button interface
9*) Move club removal to the left side of the screen, hook it up to the dropdown
10*) Create confirmation for session Creation
11*) Add No Show status
       During notes parsing, make another column for no show, if no show is in the notes, have that col value be true
12*)  One way or another make the session name universally accessible 
13) Manual status divide into 2, cash and paypal error
14) AnkleBreaker notes column for user notes
15) Implement for when the waitlist is full

Things to implement before our meeting today
1) Creation of the file, edit tab in the top left, for now just have exit program, load session, reset session. Another tab for marking a session as paid, unpaid, and deleting a session
2) Deimplement no show as a status, instead have it be a modifier and have it be a part of the AnkleBreaker note
       Allow the user to modify the AnkleBreaker note
3) Flagging logic, initially flag based on default status, for deflagging have the user edit the current_status then check if any of the other data values have other as a current status

Things to implement after the meeting on 6/23
1*)Next to do list: remove the edit note widget from the flagged sessions 
2*)Implement when you double click on a file, have that file be presented in the browse all files tab
3) QOL have folder dialog boxes open to the AnkleBreakerdata folder
4) File dropdown duplicates
5*) After deleting, update the graphic in the welcome screen (this didn't require any fixing apparently, it just worked)
       make sure the folder actually gets deleted
6) Grey out the next button in create session until a session has been created!

6/24 Meeting
1*)ON flagged sessions, swap save note button and edit note input
2*)Have load session look for AnkleBreakerData folder, should be able to just find the location where sessions are being stored
	See if the file explorer can be locked in a certain view
	Change Load Folder to Load Session
3*)Add load session button in Session Admin folder
4*) Investigate ability to turn off scrolling for when hovering over a dropdown, see what the logistics are. 
	Probably just disable it since it can only lead to unexpected outcomes
	Should be able to click then scroll
5*) Change the menu bar
	Name of button from load to AnkleBar
6) For the load file graphic, have two levels where the first level is a bunch of clubs and the second level is the sessions for those clubs
	Imagery of folders and buttons 
	Add a filter for date, add a filter for flagged, add a filter for unpaid
7*) 5 ways to load session
	Load session graphic in the welcome screen
	Load session option in the AnkleBar via file explorer
	Load session option in the AnkleBar via the file graphic of expansion
8) Have load session graphic on welcome screen sort by most recently modified

6/25
1*) Assign All and Reset All also call Save Fee Schedule, maybe have it implmemented so when the user clicks off an individual input, have it call save
2*) For Current Session Files, have a button to click to view all (put it in the dropdown) , just have to add a column for file name
3*) Same for assign status screen, would have to add file name in button row graphic
4*) Move current session files tab to the right of program tab
5*) For Browse All files tab, instead of club then date then file, do club then session then file
6*) Load session from folder in session admin tab and anklebar need to open the sessions folder
7*) In all of the QTreeWidgets, have the top level include their paid status
8*) Apparently most recent session folder sorting does not work, make it work. 
       Change label from Browse Existing Sessions to Recent Sessions
9*) In Session Admin folder dates are being duplicated, make it not so
10*) Add Delete Session to the AnkleBar, make it do an OpenFileDialog and have a confirmation

6/27
1*) Negatives in the Financial summary screen are still happening, fix manual logic
2) Select a date in session admin?
       Resolution, session admin tab not needed since the buttons are going in the past club session
       In the Past Club Sessions page, after clicking into a club's files, have a dropdown for date filtering, include a view all button
3*) Color scheme change for the red in current session files
4*) Include names of currently selected files in the welcome screen, grey out the next button (I think this means on the create session tab)
5*) Isolate next button from the rest of the buttons in the welcome screen
6*) Remove the exit program button
7*) Change "Browse existing sessions" label to "Browse recent sessions"
8*) Change Graphical Session Loader to Past Club Sessions
9*) In the GSL the Back to Welcome screen should be changed such that it brings you back to the screen you were just on
10*) When a session is created lock the upload button until a session is reset or marked as completed (when that session is paid)
       Should also unlock when Paid
11) Be able to view the total similar to the paid/unpaid status, what total does he want? gross? tih cut? basic breakdown? Nolan thinks Club Cut but need to confirm with Travis
12) GSL actually becomes session admin
       Add session admin buttons to the Past Club Sessions, meaning mark as paid, unpaid, delete, and load
13) Merge the load files and load folder button
14*) Keep it such that when files are added, it overrides the current selection
       When adding new files, create confirmation window letting the user know they are about to override the current selection
              Be sure to include the current file names (and paths?) in the confirmation window message


6/30
1) Do incompletes from 6/27
2) Grey out next button on create session screen until a session has bee ncrated

7/1
1*) Merge load files and load folder button
       No way to be able to handle files or folders in one button, reverted it back
2*) Grey out next button on create session screen until a session has been created 
       The solution here may just be to remvoe the next button since after creating a session it just goes to the assign status screen
3*) Session Admin features implemented into Past Club Sessions
       Mark paid
       Mark unpaid
       Delete session
       Load session isn't necessary since we're already loading it
       Should already have single click selection done, just need to bind it to a state variable
4*) Add total to the QTreeWidgets view, if no total say so, if not then include Club cut
5*) Grey out next on fee schedule until all of the files have fee schedules assigned
       Calling reset all should grey out the button
6*) Fee schedule is not being remembered
7*) In flagged sessions, double clicking on a file name goes to browse all files
       Currently cannot edit AnkleBreaker note, need to fix that
8*) Just ran into a weird error where a file was flagged but the statuses of the people were not other, must Investigate
9*) Upon deflagging a file, the view all option disappeared
10*) Remove extra buttons from the welcome screen
11*) Exiting the past club sessions needs to refresh the widgets, did not update browse recent sessions
12*) After unflagging, in current session files a duplicate is being used

7/2
1*) Gray out next button in status assignment while there are people with other
2*) Unflagging is deleting (most of) the files but the old names are still appearing in the dropdowns seemingly randomly
3*) Remove previous screen button from the view of doubleclicking on the folder, just have the back button
4) Implement warning/error handling for when a file is not found or cannot be accessed (for unflagging overwriting purposes)
5*) Past Club Sessions should check to see if you're already there, if so then do nothing

7/6
1*) Fix unflagging for stateside running
2) Refactor
       Unify imports
       Remove unnecessary code
       Clean up directory
       Clean up git repository
       Comment code
3*) Remove all mentions to reflagging
4*) Add more in depth debugging information, crash log?
5*) Implement a manual unflagging/reflagging in case this doesn't work?

7/6 Part 2
1) When files are selected and reset session is clicked, crashes due to list indices
2) Past Club Sessions if you press it multiple times can loop so previous screen won't work
       Reset session makes it work again from what has been tested but this must be investigated
       Solution here is most likely to just lock Past Club Sessions when it's open
3) Currently if the user creates the session, then deletes the session in PCS, the next button in the create session screen is enabled
       This needs to not be the case
       Need to improve logic for tracking if current session exists and is active

7/7 Part 1
1) Previous screen button in the PCS was not working if the user was clicking it from another tab
       This has been resolved
2) But the problem still remains that if a user clicks into PCS from a non-Program tab it will stop the user from being able to access their spot in the program
       Solution is to add a back to program button so the user can go back to their spot in the program

7/8
1) When uploading a folder, non-csv files are silently ignored. Maybe make them not silently ignored? 
2) For sorting in browse recent sessions, session needs to be edited in order for it to be updated
       Change sorting method so that it is based on opening and not editing
!3!) Back to program button does not work when PCS is opened from the welcome screen
4) Only works on unprocessed files, files that have already been processed fail
       Change this so the user can upload 'bad' files but tell them about it
!5!) Uploaded files label in the welcome screen needs to be reset when current session is deleted
6) Tab needs to me made that is the same as Flagged but for all so AnkleBreaker Note can be edited
7) Remove status assignment flagged label
8) In executable if a file from the active session is open, editing it in AB will have AB full crash
       Need to implement error handling
9) Fee schedule change from >=0 to >= 1
       Needs to allow for float values as well
