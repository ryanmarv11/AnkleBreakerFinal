*1) Change Zorano column in summary table to the club name for the session
*2) Unify refresh button    
*3) Implement unflagging (revisit this, it's broken)
       User edits the csv  
       Program updates the flag status after checking
       Create another status column
       Change flagging to be based on the current status
*4) Put the current_status in the files so when loading a session the choices get remembered
       update browse any session file refresh too
*5) Refunds are free, fix the logic for that
*6) Double check the manual logic
*7) In the welcome screen, make a load session graphic
       Click once on a folder it expands it to reveal the files inside
       Click twice on a folder, pop up a confirmation to load the session
8*) Move the reset session button to its own tab?
       Mimic file edit design in the topleft, try to include current session name as a text label within the row button interface
9*) Move club removal to the left side of the screen, hook it up to the dropdown
10*) Create confirmation for session Creation
11*) Add No Show status
       During notes parsing, make another column for no show, if no show is in the notes, have that col value be true
12*)  One way or another make the session name universally accessible 
13) Manual status divide into 2, cash and paypal error
14) AnkleBreaker notes column for user notes
15) Implement for when the waitlist is full

Things to implement before our meeting today
1) Creation of the file, edit tab in the top left, for now just have exit program, load session, reset session. Another tab for marking a session as paid, unpaid, and deleting a session
2) Deimplement no show as a status, instead have it be a modifier and have it be a part of the AnkleBreaker note
       Allow the user to modify the AnkleBreaker note
3) Flagging logic, initially flag based on default status, for deflagging have the user edit the current_status then check if any of the other data values have other as a current status

Things to implement after the meeting on 6/23
1*)Next to do list: remove the edit note widget from the flagged sessions 
2*)Implement when you double click on a file, have that file be presented in the browse all files tab
3) QOL have folder dialog boxes open to the AnkleBreakerdata folder
4) File dropdown duplicates
5*) After deleting, update the graphic in the welcome screen (this didn't require any fixing apparently, it just worked)
       make sure the folder actually gets deleted
6) Grey out the next button in create session until a session has been created!

6/24 Meeting
1*)ON flagged sessions, swap save note button and edit note input
2*)Have load session look for AnkleBreakerData folder, should be able to just find the location where sessions are being stored
	See if the file explorer can be locked in a certain view
	Change Load Folder to Load Session
3*)Add load session button in Session Admin folder
4*) Investigate ability to turn off scrolling for when hovering over a dropdown, see what the logistics are. 
	Probably just disable it since it can only lead to unexpected outcomes
	Should be able to click then scroll
5*) Change the menu bar
	Name of button from load to AnkleBar
6) For the load file graphic, have two levels where the first level is a bunch of clubs and the second level is the sessions for those clubs
	Imagery of folders and buttons 
	Add a filter for date, add a filter for flagged, add a filter for unpaid
7*) 5 ways to load session
	Load session graphic in the welcome screen
	Load session option in the AnkleBar via file explorer
	Load session option in the AnkleBar via the file graphic of expansion
8) Have load session graphic on welcome screen sort by most recently modified
