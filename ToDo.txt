*1) Change Zorano column in summary table to the club name for the session
*2) Unify refresh button    
*3) Implement unflagging (revisit this, it's broken)
       User edits the csv  
       Program updates the flag status after checking
       Create another status column
       Change flagging to be based on the current status
*4) Put the current_status in the files so when loading a session the choices get remembered
       update browse any session file refresh too
*5) Refunds are free, fix the logic for that
*6) Double check the manual logic
*7) In the welcome screen, make a load session graphic
       Click once on a folder it expands it to reveal the files inside
       Click twice on a folder, pop up a confirmation to load the session
8*) Move the reset session button to its own tab?
       Mimic file edit design in the topleft, try to include current session name as a text label within the row button interface
9*) Move club removal to the left side of the screen, hook it up to the dropdown
10*) Create confirmation for session Creation
11*) Add No Show status
       During notes parsing, make another column for no show, if no show is in the notes, have that col value be true
12*)  One way or another make the session name universally accessible 
13) Manual status divide into 2, cash and paypal error
14) AnkleBreaker notes column for user notes
15) Implement for when the waitlist is full

Things to implement before our meeting today
1) Creation of the file, edit tab in the top left, for now just have exit program, load session, reset session. Another tab for marking a session as paid, unpaid, and deleting a session
2) Deimplement no show as a status, instead have it be a modifier and have it be a part of the AnkleBreaker note
       Allow the user to modify the AnkleBreaker note
3) Flagging logic, initially flag based on default status, for deflagging have the user edit the current_status then check if any of the other data values have other as a current status

Things to implement after the meeting on 6/23
1*)Next to do list: remove the edit note widget from the flagged sessions 
2*)Implement when you double click on a file, have that file be presented in the browse all files tab
3) QOL have folder dialog boxes open to the AnkleBreakerdata folder
4) File dropdown duplicates
5*) After deleting, update the graphic in the welcome screen (this didn't require any fixing apparently, it just worked)
       make sure the folder actually gets deleted
6) Grey out the next button in create session until a session has been created!

6/24 Meeting
1*)ON flagged sessions, swap save note button and edit note input
2*)Have load session look for AnkleBreakerData folder, should be able to just find the location where sessions are being stored
	See if the file explorer can be locked in a certain view
	Change Load Folder to Load Session
3*)Add load session button in Session Admin folder
4*) Investigate ability to turn off scrolling for when hovering over a dropdown, see what the logistics are. 
	Probably just disable it since it can only lead to unexpected outcomes
	Should be able to click then scroll
5*) Change the menu bar
	Name of button from load to AnkleBar
6) For the load file graphic, have two levels where the first level is a bunch of clubs and the second level is the sessions for those clubs
	Imagery of folders and buttons 
	Add a filter for date, add a filter for flagged, add a filter for unpaid
7*) 5 ways to load session
	Load session graphic in the welcome screen
	Load session option in the AnkleBar via file explorer
	Load session option in the AnkleBar via the file graphic of expansion
8) Have load session graphic on welcome screen sort by most recently modified

6/25
1*) Assign All and Reset All also call Save Fee Schedule, maybe have it implmemented so when the user clicks off an individual input, have it call save
2*) For Current Session Files, have a button to click to view all (put it in the dropdown) , just have to add a column for file name
3*) Same for assign status screen, would have to add file name in button row graphic
4*) Move current session files tab to the right of program tab
5*) For Browse All files tab, instead of club then date then file, do club then session then file
6*) Load session from folder in session admin tab and anklebar need to open the sessions folder
7*) In all of the QTreeWidgets, have the top level include their paid status
8*) Apparently most recent session folder sorting does not work, make it work. 
       Change label from Browse Existing Sessions to Recent Sessions
9*) In Session Admin folder dates are being duplicated, make it not so
10*) Add Delete Session to the AnkleBar, make it do an OpenFileDialog and have a confirmation

6/27
1*) Negatives in the Financial summary screen are still happening, fix manual logic
2) Select a date in session admin?
       Resolution, session admin tab not needed since the buttons are going in the past club session
       In the Past Club Sessions page, after clicking into a club's files, have a dropdown for date filtering, include a view all button
3*) Color scheme change for the red in current session files
4*) Include names of currently selected files in the welcome screen, grey out the next button (I think this means on the create session tab)
5*) Isolate next button from the rest of the buttons in the welcome screen
6*) Remove the exit program button
7*) Change "Browse existing sessions" label to "Browse recent sessions"
8*) Change Graphical Session Loader to Past Club Sessions
9*) In the GSL the Back to Welcome screen should be changed such that it brings you back to the screen you were just on
10*) When a session is created lock the upload button until a session is reset or marked as completed (when that session is paid)
       Should also unlock when Paid
11) Be able to view the total similar to the paid/unpaid status, what total does he want? gross? tih cut? basic breakdown? Nolan thinks Club Cut but need to confirm with Travis
12) GSL actually becomes session admin
       Add session admin buttons to the Past Club Sessions, meaning mark as paid, unpaid, delete, and load
13) Merge the load files and load folder button
14*) Keep it such that when files are added, it overrides the current selection
       When adding new files, create confirmation window letting the user know they are about to override the current selection
              Be sure to include the current file names (and paths?) in the confirmation window message


6/30
1) Do incompletes from 6/27
2) Grey out next button on create session screen until a session has bee ncrated

7/1
1*) Merge load files and load folder button
       No way to be able to handle files or folders in one button, reverted it back
2*) Grey out next button on create session screen until a session has been created 
       The solution here may just be to remvoe the next button since after creating a session it just goes to the assign status screen
3*) Session Admin features implemented into Past Club Sessions
       Mark paid
       Mark unpaid
       Delete session
       Load session isn't necessary since we're already loading it
       Should already have single click selection done, just need to bind it to a state variable
4*) Add total to the QTreeWidgets view, if no total say so, if not then include Club cut
5*) Grey out next on fee schedule until all of the files have fee schedules assigned
       Calling reset all should grey out the button
6*) Fee schedule is not being remembered
7*) In flagged sessions, double clicking on a file name goes to browse all files
       Currently cannot edit AnkleBreaker note, need to fix that
8*) Just ran into a weird error where a file was flagged but the statuses of the people were not other, must Investigate
9*) Upon deflagging a file, the view all option disappeared
10*) Remove extra buttons from the welcome screen
11*) Exiting the past club sessions needs to refresh the widgets, did not update browse recent sessions
12*) After unflagging, in current session files a duplicate is being used

7/2
1*) Gray out next button in status assignment while there are people with other
2*) Unflagging is deleting (most of) the files but the old names are still appearing in the dropdowns seemingly randomly
3*) Remove previous screen button from the view of doubleclicking on the folder, just have the back button
4) Implement warning/error handling for when a file is not found or cannot be accessed (for unflagging overwriting purposes)
5*) Past Club Sessions should check to see if you're already there, if so then do nothing

7/6
1*) Fix unflagging for stateside running
2) Refactor
       Unify imports
       Remove unnecessary code
       Clean up directory
       Clean up git repository
       Comment code
3*) Remove all mentions to reflagging
4*) Add more in depth debugging information, crash log?
5*) Implement a manual unflagging/reflagging in case this doesn't work?

7/6 Part 2
1) When files are selected and reset session is clicked, crashes due to list indices
2) Past Club Sessions if you press it multiple times can loop so previous screen won't work
       Reset session makes it work again from what has been tested but this must be investigated
       Solution here is most likely to just lock Past Club Sessions when it's open
3) Currently if the user creates the session, then deletes the session in PCS, the next button in the create session screen is enabled
       This needs to not be the case
       Need to improve logic for tracking if current session exists and is active

7/7 Part 1
1) Previous screen button in the PCS was not working if the user was clicking it from another tab
       This has been resolved
2) But the problem still remains that if a user clicks into PCS from a non-Program tab it will stop the user from being able to access their spot in the program
       Solution is to add a back to program button so the user can go back to their spot in the program

7/8
1*) When uploading a folder, non-csv files are silently ignored. Maybe make them not silently ignored? 
2*) For sorting in browse recent sessions, session needs to be edited in order for it to be updated
       Change sorting method so that it is based on opening and not editing
3*) Back to program button does not work when PCS is opened from the welcome screen
4*) Only works on unprocessed files, files that have already been processed fail
       Change this so the user can upload 'bad' files but tell them about it
5*) Uploaded files label in the welcome screen needs to be reset when current session is deleted
6*) Tab needs to me made that is the same as Flagged but for all so AnkleBreaker Note can be edited
7*) Remove status assignment flagged label
8) In executable if a file from the active session is open, editing it in AB will have AB full crash
       Need to implement error handling
9*) Fee schedule change from >=0 to >= 1
       Needs to allow for float values as well
10*) Lock fee schedule editing while the session is paid, user must have the session be unpaid to edit the fee schedule
11) Implement tool tips for the buttons if the button can be disabled
12*) Just did a fee schedule update, it was 0'd out but then when I put in the real value even after the math the total did not change the graphic  
       Also the fee schedule was not saved successfully in the metadata
       Fix for this, need to ensure that when the fee schedule is saved it redoes the math
13) Maybe remove the save from the next button or make it so that it silently warns the user or somethign like that

7/9
When session is marked as paid, disable the fee schedule inputs, assign all button, reset all button, save fee schedule button
In the welcome page have a tooltip for status assignment
Implement comped list again, have it supercede other logic for default status 
Reimplement mark as paid button on the payment summary screen
Have all fee schedules default to 10.00 since it's just Zorano
In all sessions tab, make sure we're sorting by last opened metadata
Remove flagged sessions tab, do Nolan's suggestion for adding filters
       Filter for flagged, filter for unpaid, filter for paid
Allow for the user to select where the AnkleBreakerData folder is saved, include base location in metadata
       this way if the file needs to be moved/gets deleted the user can update the base directory location
Total is not being updated
Allow for editing of the session even though the status is paid

7/11
Easy
1*) Add Mark as Paid button to Payment Summary Screen 
2*) In the welcome screen, put an info tooltip for the format of notes 
       Regular
       Manual
       Waitlist
       Comped
       Refund
       Other
       Paypal issue should be Regular
       Cash payment should be Manual
3*) Have all fee schedule values default to 10
4*) Allow for editing of the session, its statuses, and its fee schedule even when paid
5*) In all sessions make sure that we are sorting by the last_opened metadata
6*) Remove flagged sessions tab
Medium
1*) Reimplement list of comped people, add to if logic for comped default status
       Look for old comped.txt, that will be the original
       Implement feature in the menu bar for adding/removing people to the list
       All of this should be stored in the metadata
1 cont)
       Making a list of comped people that the user can add/subtract from will be a feature for the next iteration of AB
2*) Ability to select destination for AnkleBreaker Data folder
       Make metadata for initial run
       Should look for old metadata file and kill it(??)
3*) In all sessions tab (for editing AnkleBreaker Notes), implement filter for flagged, unpaid, and paid
Hard
1*) Statuses are not being remembered by the program    
       Implement a metadata fix or do file IO's
1 conc)
       So, it works now but the user has to click on the next button in order for the changes to be saved
       Maybe for the next iteration have it such that the current changes are stored somewhere in the state variable
       Then if the user tries to close the session or do anything other than click the next button it asks if the user wants to save their changes
       Could list changes individually or just lump them into one warning
2*) Total is not being updated in QTreeWidgets when fee schedule is updated
       When fee schedule is updated and saved to the metadata, refresh the tree widgets
       Or if the math is being done after that, do it whenever the math is done
       Make sure that the math is triggering
              Maybe have the math refresh whenever a fee schedule changes?

7/16
1*) Disable create session button while there is a current session
2*) Remove duplicate PCS entry
3*) Make bullet point for PayPal in Welcome Screen tooltip
4*) When resetting all, make it so it doesn't have that window pop up, or just default them all to 10
5*) Change warning message and logic to be < 0, probably just remove it
6*) Reset filters is not doing a true reset, refresh the graphic?

7/17
1) Have reset button in assign fee schedule screen reset values to 10.0
2) Have select files and select folder button in welcome screen open to downloads folder

Part 2
1*) Next button removed in create session screen
2*) Window size bigger, make sure that it scales when window is further expanded
3*) Divide other graphic in two, have the bottom half be the counts
4*) After marking as paid, and clicking ok, bring user to all sessions screen
5) Make it load faster!
6*) Session creation is making a duplicate session folder but all folders are empty
7*) Move the notes button to assign status screen
8*) Change set data folder location to make the folder
For the future) If we could have the amount that was paid in the notes, something for processing it if it's in the price

Temporary) Put the margins back in between buttons in the top right
Make button sizes the same for view all and individual file view
7/22
1*) Assign status screen, font should be smaller and not bold
2*) Assign status screen, make the other graphic smaller, put the notes legend on the other side of the Other graphic
3*) Assign status screen, Make the rows thicker
4*) Assign fee schedule screen, remove reset all and save fee schedule buttons
5*) Assign fee schedule screen, implement save fee schedule feature to back button
6*) Assign fee schedule screen, make sure that decimals are never cut off
7*) Assign fee schedule screen, add confirmation dialog to assign all
8*) Payment summary screen, group tables by price
9*) Payment summary screen, have the graphic be similar to the assign status layout where there's an extra space
10*) Payment summary screen, remove mark as unpaid button
11*) Make AnkleBar icon a settings wheel
12*) All sessions tab, remove highlighted background
13*) All sessions tab, make it bigger
14*) All sessions tab, change label to Edit Player Notes
15*) All sessions tab, turn filters into radio buttons, have reset filters be a pulldown
16*) AnkleBar order, Home, Load Session Folder, Delete Dession Folder, Reset Session, Set Data Folder Location
17*) All QTreeWidgets must also always have 2 decimal points
18* Look up how to ensure that a font is downloaded or included in the executable
